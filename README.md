Crate is a libcontainer based container manager.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with an overlay network to make containers from different hosts act as if they are on the same virtual network.  Container IPs are intended to be stable and unique across the network, so containers can be moved around by only adjusting routing entires.

For more details of the networking see: network.md
